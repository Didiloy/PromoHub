# PromoHub
An android app to track games promotion
## Disclaimer
PromoHub uses the CheapShark API to find and track game deals but is not affiliated with CheapShark in any way. Deal links have to go through CheapShark's redirect URL but this should not affect your price. As per CheapShark's API documentation, all prices shown are in USD.

PromoHub has no control over the prices, it simply plugs into the CheapShark API and displays the information as is.

### TODO
- [x] Page to filter stores
- [ ] Page to select the number of deals to display, the sort direction, the sort type and the maxAge of the deal
- [ ] Page to select the lower and upper price limit, the metacritic score and the steam rating, if it's a AAA game and if it's a currently on sale
- [ ] Page to display the results
### Ideas
- [ ] Add a search page to search for a specific game by title
